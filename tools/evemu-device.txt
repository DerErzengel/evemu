EVEMU-DEVICE(1)
===============

NAME
----

     evemu-device, evemu-play  - create a virtual input device and replay an
     event sequence

SYNOPSIS
--------
     evemu-device [description-file]

     evemu-play /dev/input/eventX < event-sequence

DESCRIPTION
-----------
evemu-device creates a virtual input device based on the description-file.
This description is usually created by evemu-describe(1). evemu-device then
creates a new input device with uinput and prints the name and the device
file to
stdout.

evemu-play replays the event sequence given on stdin through the input
device. The event sequence must be in the form created by evemu-record(1).

evemu-device must be able to write to the uinput device node, and evemu-play
must be able to write to the device node specified; in most cases this means
it must be run as root.
