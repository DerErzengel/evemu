Stephen's got some good examples for ctypes support here:
 * http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bregma/utouch-geis/python-geis/view/head:/geis.py

In particular:
 * line 289, the init for Geis, working around the issue of pointers getting
   initialized inside a C function
 * line 295 for garbage collection
 * 299 and 265, for the byref trick

Let's start with a simple case first:
 * try to get extract working

Actaully, that's not so simple -- after talking with Henrik, he clarified that
extract works directly against an input device, not against files.

What I need to do first are these things:
 * create a virtual device from a recorded device file
 * replay the events from a recorded events file
