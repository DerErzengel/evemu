BUGS
====
 * device nodes are created for each unit test and stick around until the last
   unit test
 *


NOTES
=====
Stephen's got some good examples for ctypes support here:
 * http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bregma/utouch-geis/python-geis/view/head:/geis.py

In particular:
 * line 289, the init for Geis, working around the issue of pointers getting
   initialized inside a C function
 * line 295 for garbage collection
 * 299 and 265, for the byref trick

Let's start with a simple case first:
 * try to get extract working

Actaully, that's not so simple -- after talking with Henrik, he clarified that
extract works directly against an input device, not against files.

What I need to do first are these things:
 * create a virtual device from a recorded device file
 * replay the events from a recorded events file

The script does this:
 * main()
   * take the deivce/properties file as a parameter
   * calls evemu_device, passing a filepointer for the properties file
 * evemu_device
   * takes the passed file pointer
 * identify a device file
 * write the properties to the device file
 * describe the device file


 MIND-STATE DUMP
 ===============

  * currently working on debuggin why devices aren't being deleted after each
    test (instead, they are being deleted once all tests have finished)

  * tracing through the evemu-device program to identify any logic in the C
    that's missing in the Python implementation

  * the reason for the activity of the last bullet point: only the device nam,e
    is being written to the devices, not the actual device data
